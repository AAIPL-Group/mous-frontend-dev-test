# Mous Front End Developer Test

## Prerequisites
* A GitHub account
* Access to test design on inVision
* Access/a copy of the [website assets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8lbgvkihdeidtk5/AAAws9r--tCp4Al04Y6R2M2Ga?dl=0)

## Exercise
The exercise is to build a static webpage following the given inVision design as closely as possible. You are free to use any frameworks, compilers and libraries you see fit but will be expected to explain why you chose them should you be invited for an interview. You must use the assets provided in the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8lbgvkihdeidtk5/AAAws9r--tCp4Al04Y6R2M2Ga?dl=0). You should submit your finished page as a pull request to this repository.

## What submissions will be tested on
* How accurately they were able to re-create the inVision design.
* Presentation on both desktop and mobile.
* The quality of their commit messages, pull requests and approach to branching.
* The quality of their code, including:
	- Naming conventions
	- Separation of concerns
	- Readability

### Bonus:
In addition to submitting a pull request, you should try to host your webpage on an amazon S3 bucket and CloudFront CDN or free alternative. Please add the URL to this readme as part of the pull request.
